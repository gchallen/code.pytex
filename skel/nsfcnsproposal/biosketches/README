Two options here. (1) is preferred, as this will both lead to consistent
formatting and allow your contribution to be built as part of the full
proposal.

1) Use my template:
  1) $ cp template.tex <firstname><lastname>.tex
     $ cp template-separate.tex <firtsname><lastname>-separate.tex
  2) Edit template-separate.tex, replacing template.tex with
  <firstname><lastname>.tex.
  3) Edit template.tex as appropriate. Using \nocite{} instead of \cite{}
  will ensure that your publications are not numbered but included in the
  list of references.
  4) Edit Makefile. Add <firstname><lastname>-separate.tex to the build
  targets. A build in this directory should succeed.
  5) Edit biosketches.tex, adding <firstname><lastname>.tex where
  appropriate. A build in the parent directory should succeed and include
  your biosketch.
  6) Add <firstname><lastname>.tex and <firstname><lastname>-separate.tex to
  the repository; commit your other changes.
 
2) Include your own 2-page CV as a PDF file. Please name it
<firstname><lastname>.pdf (geoffreychallen.pdf) and add it to the git
repository in this directory.
