% 03 Feb 2011 : GWA : Example from prior proposal.
%
% \begin{broaderimpacts}
%
% \item In \textbf{Year~1}, the co-PIs will establish a \textit{shared
% database of component power measurements}. Seeded with output of research
% tasks R\ref{R1} and R\ref{R2}, the database will gather power consumption
% information collected by researchers at multiple institutions. By providing
% a set of workloads, the database will facilitate accurate component
% comparisons. \uline{Aggregating this information will greatly accelerate
% research in this area by elimination the duplication of effort necessary to
% understand component power consumption.}
